IMDb Clone
An interactive movie database web application inspired by IMDb, built to provide users with a rich experience of exploring movies, actors, and personalizing their profiles.

Features
Favorite Actors
Users can "favorite" actors by clicking a heart icon on their profiles. A dedicated Favorite Actors page displays all favorited actors with their images and names.

Trending Movies Carousel
The homepage includes a sleek horizontal carousel showcasing trending movies. The carousel supports autoplay, is draggable, and has navigation arrows and dots for easy browsing.

User Profile Page
Users have a profile page where they can view and manage their watchlist, rated movies, and reviews. They can also edit their username, profile picture, and personal preferences.

Authentication
Login and signup modals feature basic form validation. User authentication state is managed globally using Redux (or Context API) for a seamless experience.

Star Ratings
Users can rate movies using a star-based system. The average rating is dynamically calculated and displayed on each movie card.

Actor Profiles
A dedicated page lists actor profiles showing their images, names, and the movies they have acted in.

Watchlist Management
Users can add movies to their watchlist. The watchlist is stored locally using browser storage (or a mock API) to persist user choices.

Advanced Search and Filtering
A powerful search and filtering system supports multiple parameters such as genre, year, and actor. Search results update in real-time with loading indicators and debounce handling to optimize performance.

Real-time Data Fetching
Movie, show, and actor data is fetched in real-time from external APIs like TMDb or OMDb. The app handles rate limiting and error states gracefully to ensure reliability.

Reviews and Voting
Users can write, edit, and delete reviews for movies. Reviews support upvotes and downvotes and can be sorted by “most helpful” or “most recent.”

Detailed Movie Pages
Movie detail pages display cast, trailers, reviews, and images fetched from the API. Trailers and images are presented in a responsive carousel format.
